the tests help you decide whether you should model the series as
	stationary around a constant
	stationary around a deterministic trend
	difference stationary (unit root, needs differencing)
They do not usually tell you to “discover an arbitrary function” for the deterministic part. In practice you choose a simple deterministic structure (constant, linear trend, seasonal dummies) because otherwise you can overfit and create misleading inference.
How this looks in a natural gas price project
Step 1: Decide what series you are modeling
Most price levels behave like nonstationary processes.
A common move is to work with log price p_t=\ln\funcapply(P_t), then either
	returns: \Delta p_t
	differences: \Delta P_t
depending on your goal.
Step 2: Choose which deterministic terms are plausible
Common deterministic pieces:
	constant (drift)
	linear trend (rarely a good long run description for commodity prices, but you can test it)
	seasonality (very relevant for natural gas, often monthly or weekly patterns)
Step 3: Run ADF and KPSS in matched versions
You generally run them in pairs because their nulls are opposite.
	ADF with constant, KPSS level stationarity
	ADF with constant + trend, KPSS trend stationarity
Interpretation patterns:
	ADF fails to reject unit root AND KPSS rejects stationarity
Strong evidence you need differencing (unit root behavior)
	ADF rejects unit root AND KPSS fails to reject stationarity
Strong evidence the series is stationary (around level or trend, depending on spec)
Step 4: Pick the transformation based on results
Case A: unit root in levels (common for prices)
Work with \Delta p_tor \Delta P_t. Then test stationarity again on the transformed series.
Case B: trend stationary
Model y_tas trend + stationary residual:
y_t=\alpha+\beta t+x_t,x_t\mathrm{\ stationary}

Equivalent workflow: regress y_ton 1t, take residuals {\hat{x}}_t, then model {\hat{x}}_twith ARMA.
Case C: stationary around constant
Model directly with ARMA (or ARX if you have predictors).
Step 5: Where the “function fitting” idea fits
If by “functor” you mean “a function that captures deterministic structure,” the standard options are:
	constant and/or linear trend
	seasonal dummies (monthly indicators)
	known calendar effects (day of week)
	deterministic break dummies if you know there’s a regime change date
Beyond that, the deterministic part is usually handled by adding relevant explanatory variables instead of forcing a flexible time function.
Step 6: After stationarity, you fit a model for prediction
If you end up with a stationary target series, typical choices:
	ARMA or ARIMA (if you differenced)
	ARIMAX/ARX (if you have exogenous predictors like storage, weather proxies, etc.)
	GARCH type volatility models if you care about variance forecasts, because returns can be uncorrelated but still show volatility clustering
